# NewsApp

# This app for example for News. Only one admin is available and this admin created as code first.
# This app for tutorial and for this i will share admin information to check my application.


# I created only one admin and this admin can do this:
# 1)Look users
# 2)Create-Edit-Delete news with photo
# 3)Create-Edit-Delete categories
# 4)Add comment and delete all comments

# Other users can only add comments and only delete their own comments

# I created many-to-many relaationship with News and Categories
# I created one-to-many relationship with Comments and Users

# Search button is active, Admin panel for operations is active, Login-Register-Logout is active.
# As Db, I used Microsoft Sql Server. 

# Thanks!
